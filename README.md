# Amber handwritten notes app
Amber is a UWP app which helps you create handwritten notes in a book format.  
  
While Microsoft Whiteboard offers a lot of great tools for handwriting, it is tough to organize several pages on notes on the whiteboard canvas offered by it. Some other apps like Bamboo Paper offer notebook-like pages, but their writing experience is not as good as Microsoft Whiteboard.  
  
Amber is an attempt to create a notebook-like experience while trying to match the tools and experience of Microsoft Whiteboard.

## Feature roadmap
